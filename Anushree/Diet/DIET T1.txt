6. Hydration: Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water is essential for overall health and can help regulate blood sugar levels.

7. Avoid Sugary Foods: Limiting or avoiding sugary foods and drinks can help manage blood sugar levels.

8. Meal Planning: Planning meals in advance can help individuals with type 1 diabetes manage their blood sugar levels and ensure they are getting the necessary nutrients.
